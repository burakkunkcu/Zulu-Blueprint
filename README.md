# ProjectLab

Zulu is an Android app which is designed to manage projects. It offers to-do-lists, calendars, deadlines, a chat platform, progress bar, and a meetUp feature (that help the team leader to organise meetings just in seconds) that all help the group members which are connected by this app. The group members will have a hierarchical order and team leader will have the ability to assign tasks to the members and track the progress of them.
Zulu is simply your new project assistant.
